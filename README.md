# Byte Kitchen FE coding test (Gym admin)

In this coding test, you will build a web application for managing gym members. This repository contains the API server that the front-end developers will use to fetch and update data. (**Important**: please don't update the ./api project)

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://abel-sintaro@bitbucket.org/mat-sparare/gym-fe-coding-test.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the `api` directory:

   ```
   cd api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

By default, the server will listen on port 4000. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

# The task

## Front-End Development (Admin page)

The front-end developers should use the Nextjs application inside the `app`. They should then use MUI-5 for the UI components and SWR for communicating with the API data. The front-end should allow users to:

- Log in to a gym and get a JWT token
- See detail information about the authenticated gym
- Create a new member for the authenticated gym
- Update a member for the authenticated gym
- Display list of members (name and email) of the authenticated gym (List page)
- Display specific member full information of the authenticated gym (Detailed page)
- Handle errors from the API and present them gracefully
- There is not specific requirement for the UI but please make it pleasant for the eye ðŸ¤©

## Good luck! ðŸ’«
